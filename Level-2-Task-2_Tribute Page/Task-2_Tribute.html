            <h2>Some inspiring quotes of Kalam </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>“Don’t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in second, more lips are waiting
                    to say that your first victory was just luck.”</li>
                <li>“You have to dream before your dreams can come true.”</li>
                <li>“I'm not a handsome guy, but I can give my hand to someone who needs help. Beauty is in the
                    heart, not in the face.”</li>
                <li>“If you fail, never give up because F.A.I.L. means “First Attempt In Learning”. End is not the
                    end, if fact E.N.D. means “Effort Never Dies.” If you get No as an answer, remember N.O. means
                    “Next Opportunity”, So let’s be positive.”</li>
                <li>“You cannot change your future, but, you can change your habits, and surely your habits will
